Web Application for tracking house hold water consumption using IOT. We have setup water flow tracking sensors throughout the 
house hold which feed readings directly on a web app connected to a user account.

The web app- Jeevan gives precise measurement of amount of water being utilized in house along with the systematic tracking in each 
room/outlet. We show various statistics which consists of real time graphs and database. 

The application also shows:
- The adequate amount of water that should be used according to per area of house
- How the consumption can be reduced

Setup:

The sensored used in circuit schematic can be attached to any outlet in the house.
Connect the arduino to the wifi feed.
Run web app on local server.
